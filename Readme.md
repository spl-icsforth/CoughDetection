## Initial setup 
1) Extract the folder containing the source files in any directory of your hard drive.
2) Install [anaconda], by downloading the installer from the official website. (e.g. Anaconda3-2020.02-Windows-x86_64.exe).
After installation, "anaconda prompt" will show up in the program list.
3) Open anaconda prompt and navigate to the folder which contains the code. (e.g. by typing "cd D:/MyDocuments/CoughDetection")
4) In Anaconda prompt type:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    in order to install all required libraries.
    This might take some time but it is important for this procedure to be completed 
    successfully.

## Running the algorithm on your data
The system should be ready to run by now. You can run the tool by calling "run_cough_detection.py" function.
1) Open anaconda prompt and navigate to the source code.
2) Run the code by passing as argument the path of the folder which contains the recordings to be analyzed.
For example, if the path is "D:/audio/saw_recordings/RP10", then we can simply type (in anaconda prompt):
    ```sh
    python run_cough_detection.py D:/audio/domestic_recordings/
    ```
* The path of the folder which contains the recordings is the only mandatory input argument.
* An additional parameter is:

	* **Number of threads** to be used. For example, if we want to engage 8 threads, we can type:
        ```sh
        python run_cough_detection.py D:/audio/domestic_recordings/ -t 8
        ```
	        
## OUTPUT 
A folder named `CoughDetections` is created and all results are stored there. For each `.wav` file in the input folder, if one or more coughs are detected:
1) A `.txt` file will be exported which contains each cough instance's timestamp as well as the corresponding level of confidence the classifier has. 
2) Additionaly a `.wav` file containing all the cough detections concatenated, is exported.

#### Important notes:
1) Tool converts recordings to 16kHz.

2) For long-duration recordings, the tool is configured to use multiple threads. Each thread handles a `maxDur` seconds segment.
The default value for `maxDur` is set to 600 seconds.

3) You can change the onset detector parameters by tweaking the hardcoded values located in the `ClipCoughDetector` class.
